Extension Icons Required
========================

Please create the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

Required Sizes:
- icon16.png  (16x16 pixels)  - Toolbar icon
- icon32.png  (32x32 pixels)  - Retina toolbar icon
- icon48.png  (48x48 pixels)  - Extension management page
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels) - Chrome Web Store and installation

Design Guidelines:
- Use the GrantSignal brand colors (purple gradient: #667eea to #764ba2)
- Include a search icon or "G" letter mark
- Ensure icons are clear and recognizable at small sizes
- Use PNG format with transparent background
- Follow Chrome Web Store icon guidelines

Alternative:
You can use a tool like https://realfavicongenerator.net/ to generate all sizes from a single source image.

Temporary Placeholder:
Until icons are created, you can use any PNG files renamed to these names for development testing.
